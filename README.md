# Window always on top
AutoHotkey Script I made some time ago and posted on the Blenderartists forum.

Here’s a little utility for when you’re short on screenspace that allows you to select any window in the Windows OS to make it Always on top. Pressing Ctrl+Windows Key+a makes the selected window always appear on top of all other windows. This is a toggle, so the same hotkey turns it off.
